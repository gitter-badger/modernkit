# modernkit
A modern web browser engine!

ModernKit implements new browser techlogies like HTML5, Javascript with EMCAScript 6, CSS3 + variables, etc...
Modernkit will support extra languages like SIML & HAML, Coffeescript, and SASS/SCSS.

Modernkit currently only parses HTML, but CSS support is planned for the next commit.
